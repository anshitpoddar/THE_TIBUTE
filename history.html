          <h2>The History and Invention</h2>
          <p>It is an enigmatic question that, who was the inventor of Tabla and how or where Tabla was originated.. However, it can be said that, Tabla has been in use in our folk music from year after year.
            There are two main different opinions about its invention of Tabla. Some people are of the opinion that, the instrument, Tabla has invented in India. And other group of people are of the opinion that, Tabla has originated from other countries not from India.People who believe about Tabla's invention from abroad, they opine that, Tabla is a foreign instrument. In India it might be come with foreign people. It is well known to all that, in different period's different people came to India. The Arabian, the Persian, the Syrian, the Turk, etc, so many people were lived in India who came from abroad. Perhaps, Tabla might be come with some of them. Some believer of this opinion, also believe that, the word Tabla is also not from an Indian language. Where 'Tabla' has come from Arabian language or might be from Persian language.according to them Tabla is an Indian instrument. Perhaps, Tabla was by different shapes or different sizes in its primitive circumstances. It might be used with local folk songs or local folk instruments or with some music styles which was not so famous. But according to this believer, Tabla's originator place is India. Most of the believer of this opinion believes that, the word 'Tabla' is a culture of Indian language. And they are not ready to think about the word 'Tabla' has any link from any foreign language or languages. It is difficult to say, Tabla has invented from India, as the word Tabla and so many instruments like Tabla, also were available in other countries. The description of several musical instruments got from Persian, Sumerian, Turkey and Babylon, have confused and compelled to think that, has Tabla not invented from other countries?
