        <h2>The inception from TRIPUSHKAR</h2>
        <p>Dr. Lalmoni Mishra also believed that, Tabla was invented from this ancient Mridung which was mentioned above. In this respect Dr. Mishra has written in his book "Bharatiya Sangit Vadya' that, infact, Tabla is evaluated from the ancient mridang instrument. In a description of mridang it is said that, ancient mridang was divided by three parts. It is also said that, on that X.U three parts of mridang was being changed from 6 or xL 7 century. And then, after some times one part of that instrument which was placed on lap and another upper headed part were in use. At the end, the upper headed part also was vanished and only ankik (which was placed on lap) was in use by taking the name mridang or muraj.In that period two upper headed parts of that mridang or by dividing ankik in-to two upper headed instruments, were prevalent. As these instruments were unable to reach such position so, it was not mentioned th in any book. By this way it was continued till 17 century. But till then two most important changes were made with that instruments. One of them, the length of those instruments was reduced and secondly, black patch (something made by iron powder and glue) was used on its right hand instrument, as it was used on right portion of a mridang. Till then black patch which was made by wheat was used on its left hand part. This instrument was prevalent with that lower cast people who played it with lower cast dancer by tiding on west. The traditional musician did not use it. But for people, it was very simple and traditionally Indian. So, it was being used with bhajan, Kirtan etc. Even then the name of this instrument was not fixed.As it is early stated, so many Scholars like, Dr. Aban Mistry, Swamy Prajnanananda, are of opine that, Tabla has been modified from 'Pushkara' day by day.

        <h2>The inception from DUKKAD</h2>
        <p> Some are of the opinion that, the commencement of Tabla materialized from an instrument named 'Dukkad'. Dukkad is a Punjabi instrument and the meaning of the word is Two. Dukkad has also two parts, like Tabla. For this reason the supporters of this opinion believe that, Tabla is a reformed version of the two part Dukkad instrument</p>

        <h2>The inception from SAMBAL</h2>
        <p> In ancient India there was a rhythm instrument named 'Sambal'. Sambal was a pair instrument, one part of this instrument was imagined as a male instrument and another part of this instrument was known as female instrument. According to one opinion, the present Tabla is a refined form of this 'Sambal'1. Even in the present day Sambal is used in Maharashtrian folk music. The curve and outward show of this instrument closely resemble to that of our Tabla. So the followers of this estimation consider that Tabla is the elegant form that evolved from Sambal.
